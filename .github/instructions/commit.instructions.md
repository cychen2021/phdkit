# Tips about the commit messages

- The headline (the first line of a commit message) should be concise and short, LESS THAN 10 WORDS. More contents should be splitted into bullet lists in the body.
- The headline should start with a capitalized verb and end without a period.
- Use `code_item` to refer to code items.
- Use `path/filename` (e.g., `.github/instructions/commit.md`) to refer to a file or directory.
- Put important things to the first.
- One line for minor changes.
- One empty line between the headline and the body.
